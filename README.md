# StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
StayBackend is a backend simulation of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. This project challenges learners to explore core backend development principles through a comprehensive full-stack application build. It emphasizes backend architecture, database design, API development, application security, and CI/CD practices to simulate professional software development workflows.

**Project Duration**: June 16 – June 23, 2025  
**Level**: Novice  
**Weight**: 1  
**Manual QA Review Required**

## Database Design

The database is structured around core entities needed to replicate Airbnb's backend logic:

### Key Entities:

1. **Users**
   - Fields: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `role`
   - Relationship: One user can have many bookings or properties (host).

2. **Properties**
   - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `host_id`
   - Relationship: Each property is owned by one user (host), but can have many bookings and reviews.

3. **Bookings**
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `total_price`
   - Relationship: Each booking links a user to a property.

4. **Reviews**
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
   - Relationship: Users leave reviews for properties they’ve booked.

5. **Payments**
   - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `payment_status`
   - Relationship: Each payment is tied to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

1. **User Management**
   - Handles user registration, login, profile management, and role assignment (guest or host).

2. **Property Management**
   - Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with details like location, availability, and pricing.

3. **Booking System**
   - Enables guests to search for properties, view availability, and make bookings securely.

4. **Review System**
   - Users can leave feedback and ratings for properties after a stay, enhancing user trust and platform transparency.

5. **Payment Integration**
   - Simulated secure payment processing for bookings, linking transactions to user and booking records.

## API Security

Security is a critical component of backend development, particularly in a platform handling sensitive data.

### Key Security Measures:
- **Authentication**: JWT-based login system to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to restrict users from accessing unauthorized resources.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle API requests to prevent abuse or DDoS attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and malformed input through validation libraries.
- **Secure Payments**: Payment data is encrypted and validated through a simulated secure API.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the build, test, and deployment phases of development. This ensures faster iterations and early bug detection.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing and deploying code upon pushing changes.
- **Docker**: Ensures code runs reliably in any environment by using containers.
- **Linting/Testing Tools**: Used to automatically check code style and logic integrity.
